# PyBer_Analysis
We performed an exploratory analysis and created visualization using riders data to improve the rideshare services and look at the performance of each city using different variables.

#OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS:
In our initial analysis in the module we created pie charts that gave us an oveall picture of 
* % total rides by city type,
* % total drivers by city type,
* % total fares by city type.

However, for a comparison between the city types; We then explored more and created and merged datadrames to find out the insights of the data we had by creating a multiple chart: "Total Fares by City Type" that illustrated trends of total fares in different city type:
* Urban
* Suburban
* Rural
in the time period from Jan 2019- April 2019

## Results:

The Mupltiple- Line graph shows the highs and lows of fares in each city type.
We get the following insights through the graph above:

1.The yellow trend shows how fares in urban cities totaled from around $1,600 to $2,300 from beginning to end during this five-month period.

2.The blue trend shows how fares in rural cities totaled around $300 from beginning to end during the same time period.

3.The orange trend shows how the total fares in suruban cities fall in between urban and rural cities: around $700 to $1,300 from beginning to end during this time.

Moreover, the chart further explains that during the month of Feburary there was a peak of total fares that occured in all city types.

## Summary:
* There is large contribution of Urban cities in PyBer ridesharing.Therfore, major profit share is coming from Urban city type.
* There were more drivers than riders in the rural areas.
* For further analysis to determine other factors that are contributing to the high ride costs in rural cities and low driver fares in urban cities. We can add travel distance in our research.

Overall, PyBer ridersharing services significantly differs in rural, suruban, and urban cities given the number of rides, drivers, and fares. Data supports that there is higher usage of PyBer ridesharing services in urban cities.
